# PSNativeDataStore
PSNativeDataStore is a script module designed to store PowerShell objects in a native format to disk.  Ideal of configuration files, your code does not change as you move from server to server.  You can access your objects with the same code even if the object files are located in a different directory or drive on each server!!!
